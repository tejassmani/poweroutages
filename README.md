# Economic Analysis of Power Outages
**Authors: Tejas Mani & Willem de Haan**

## Project Overview
Originally for DSC80 at the University of California San Diego, this project works to analyze major power outages in the continental United States from 2000-2016 through an economic lens. The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182).

## Introduction
This project examines a dataset of major power outages from January 2000 to July 2016 provided by Purdue’s Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure. The goal of our analysis is to provide an economic perspective in which to examine disparities within the utility industry. How economic factors explain the length and cause of power outages will be the central question motivating our analysis. Investigating the relationship between power outages, their frequency and duration, and economic situation provides critical insight into how inequities affect United States citizens. The economic situation is defined by the aspects that explain living conditions such as region,  state’s gross domestic product, urban population, and utility statistics.

The dataset utilized in this project is comprised of 1534 rows and 56 columns, with many features that helped us conduct our analysis such as such as geographical, state economic, and composition data. The columns that were used within this analysis are grouped and defined here: 


#### Geographic & Regional Climate Data

|Column	                 |Description|
|---                     |---        |
|`'state'`               |Represents all the states in the continental U.S.|
|`'nerc_region'`	     |The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) regions involved in the outage event.|
|`'Climate Region'`	     |U.S. Climate regions as specified by National Centers for Environmental Information (nine climatically consistent regions in continental U.S.A.)|
|`'Climate Category'`	 |This represents the climate episodes corresponding to the years. The categories—“Warm”, “Cold” or “Normal” episodes of the climate are based on a threshold of ± 0.5 °C for the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI).|

#### Outage Event Data

|Column	                 |Description|
|---                     |---        |
|`'outage_duration_hours'`	            |The duration of the outage reported in hours.|
|`'cause_category'`	         |Categories of all the events causing the major power outages.|
|`'cause_category_detail'`	         |Detailed description of the event categories causing the major power outages.|
|`'Customers Affected'`	              |The number of customers affected by the outage|

#### Economic Data

|Column	                 |Description|
|---                     |---        |
|`'total_sales'`	          |Total electricity consumption in the U.S. state (megawatt-hour).|
|`'total_realgsp'`	          |Real GSP contributed by all industries (total) (measured in 2009 chained U.S. dollars).|
|`'population'`	              |Population in the U.S. state in a year.|
|`'poppct_urban'`	     |Percentage of the total population of the U.S. state represented by the urban population (in %).|
|`'popden_urban'`	     |Population density of the urban areas (persons per square mile).|


To fully utilize this data we must first clean the data. Using the cleaned data we can then perform exploratory data analysis to better understand any relations within our data pertaining to economic markers and power outages. After which we will then analyze missingness to diagnose dependency within the data. After handling missing data as necessary, we will attempt to answer this analysis's central question through hypothesis testing and predictive modeling.

## Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis
### Data Cleaning
First, we had to read our data, which uncovered quirks in the construction of the data table. To properly convert the data into a Panda’s DataFrame we had to account for the empty header rows, the repeated indices, and the unnecessary column labels. Once we sliced the raw data to only start from the 5th row (where the data actually began), we began to construct our DataFrame with the considerations of removing unneeded columns, improving column naming conventions, and creating robust time data. To address these issues we first dropped the columns that were unnecessary to our research question: `'ANOMALY.LEVEL'`, `'HURRICANE.NAMES'`, `'PCT_LAND'`, `'PCT_WATER_TOT'`,`'PCT_WATER_INLAND'`. Next, we updated the column names to fit our desired naming conventions, making all column names lowercase with underscores representing the spaces between words. Finally, we combined the date and time columns for both outage start and outage restoration to create a comprehensive `‘outage_start’` and `‘outage_restoration’` DateTime columns.

While this is not the entire list of manipulation we performed on the data, it comprises all the steps we carried out before visualizing economic trends of interest to us. A preview of the cleaned dataset is shown here:

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Univariate Analysis

The first form of univariate analysis we carried out was a simple one - visualzing the number of power outages by state using a Folium heatmap. It is clear that the trend in our data shows that most power outages happen in states with more developed industrial sectors overall - such as California, Texas, and Michigan.

We were chiefly concerned between the relationship of outages and gross state product, with our assumption being that less developed states would suffer more frequent outages. This initial assumption was not met by our state count of outages, so we were less confident it would stand once we visualized on gross state product. The geographical distribution is presented below:

The plot backs up our skepticism, as it shows that states with a higher average real GSP typically have more frequent outages. The two heatmaps overlap in which states are typically seeing more outages as well - leading us to believe that this correlation does exist in some capacity. However, these states also contain numerous large cities, leaving us to wonder about the role of how urban an area is affecting its power outage count. 

In addition to visualizing where power outages are typically occurring, we wanted to look into how they were caused. The following bar chart displays Power Outages by Cause Category, where it is increasingly clear that both severe weather and surprisingly, intentional attacks make up the most power outage causes in our dataset. We were particularly intrigued by the intentional attack category containing such a large make-up of outages, setting the stage for a future hypothesis test.

#### Bivariate Analysis

Pursuing the line of thought on highly-populated cities potentially impacting power outages we then created a plot with two variables: Population vs. Total Real GSP. We colored our data points to better illustrate the gradual increase in GSP as population simeltaneously increased, even finding that a quadratic fit line was very strong in explaining the trend of the data.

#### Aggregation
To further understand the utility experience residents of urban areas underwent we explored the cause category column. We created a pivot table indexed by both state and its urban population percent, and then displayed the outage duration proportions for each cause category. Longer outages were almost always dominated by severe weather instances, which is stagnant with our initial univariate analysis of cause category. A solid amount of overall outage durations were made up of intentional attacks - which were common in areas of high urban population percentage. We also noticed that many states had their overall outage duration dominated by a specific category, leading us to conclude that the data had many large outliers, such as the fuel supply emergency outages making up 46% of California's outage duration. This aggregation combined a lot of the economic markers we were interested in, and set us up to delve into these with further testing.
